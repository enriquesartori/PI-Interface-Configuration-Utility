## 🆘 If Build Still Fails

**Unlikely, but if it happens:**

2. The fixes I applied should resolve all known issues
3. Most likely cause would be a file upload issue

## ✅ Ready to Upload?

**Recommended approach:**
1. Start with updating the 2 most important files:
   - `Models/PIPoint.cs`
   - `Models/PIInterface.cs`
2. Then update the 4 control files
3. Commit and watch the build succeed! 🚀
