# 🚀 Upload to GitHub Using Git Bash

## Your Current Files ✅

Great! You have most of the project structure:
- ✅ Core C# files (`Program.cs`, `MainForm.cs`) 
- ✅ Project files (`.csproj`)
- ✅ Folder structure (`Models/`, `Services/`, `Controls/`, `Dialogs/`)
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/build.yml`)
- ✅ Documentation and build scripts
- ✅ Complete Git upload script (`github-upload.sh`)

## 📋 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Install Git Bash (if not installed)
1. Download from: https://git-scm.com/download/win
2. Install with default settings
3. Restart your computer if needed

### Step 2: Edit Configuration
1. **Open `github-upload.sh` in any text editor**
2. **Change these lines:**
   ```bash
   GITHUB_USERNAME="your-username-here"          # ← Change this
   GITHUB_EMAIL="your-email@example.com"         # ← Change this
   ```
3. **Replace with your actual GitHub username and email**
4. **Save the file**

### Step 3: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to https://github.com
2. Sign in (or create account)
3. Click green **"New"** button
4. **Repository name:** `PI-Interface-Configuration-Utility`
5. **Make it PUBLIC** ✅ (required for free GitHub Actions)
6. **DON'T** check any boxes (README, .gitignore, license)
7. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 4: Run Git Upload Script
1. **Right-click in your project folder**
2. **Select "Git Bash Here"** (opens Git Bash terminal)
3. **Make script executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x github-upload.sh
   ```
4. **Run the upload script:**
   ```bash
   ./github-upload.sh
   ```

### Step 5: Authenticate with GitHub
When prompted for credentials:
- **Username:** Your GitHub username
- **Password:** ⚠️ **NOT your GitHub password!** 
  - Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
  - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
  - Select scope: ✅ `repo` (full repository access)
  - Copy the generated token
  - **Use this token as your password**

## 🎯 What Will Happen

1. **Files Upload:** All your project files go to GitHub
2. **Build Starts:** GitHub Actions automatically begins building
3. **Wait 3-5 minutes:** For build to complete
4. **Download Executable:** From Actions → Artifacts section

## 📥 Getting Your Executable

After upload is complete:
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **"Actions"** tab
3. Click on the completed build (green checkmark ✅)
4. Scroll down to **"Artifacts"** section
5. Download **"PIInterfaceConfigUtility-win-x64"** (recommended)
6. Extract the `.zip` file
7. **Double-click the `.exe` to run!**

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Git Bash says "command not found"
- Git isn't installed or not in PATH
- Reinstall Git with default settings

### If authentication fails
- Make sure you're using a Personal Access Token, not your password
- Token needs `repo` scope permissions

### If build fails on GitHub
- Check the error logs in Actions tab
- Most likely missing some C# files (can be added later)

### If upload gets stuck
- Check your internet connection
- Try again with smaller batches of files

## ✅ Success Indicators

You'll know it worked when:
- ✅ Git Bash shows "SUCCESS!" message
- ✅ Your repository appears on GitHub with all files
- ✅ Actions tab shows a running or completed build
- ✅ You can download the executable from Artifacts

## 🎉 Final Result

You'll have:
- 📦 Standalone Windows executable (~70MB)
- 🚫 No .NET installation required on target machines
- ⚡ Works on any Windows 10/11 computer
- 🔧 Complete PI Interface Configuration Utility

## 🆘 Need Help?

If anything goes wrong:
1. Check the error message in Git Bash
2. Verify your GitHub username/email in the script
3. Make sure the GitHub repository exists and is public
4. Try the authentication steps again with a fresh token
